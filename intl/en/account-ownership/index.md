# Who owns a account?

Not all {{ company_name }} products include user / organization accounts. But when they do, here are the general rules guiding the way we support them:

## Administrative accounts

Accounts are owned by individuals or by organizations. If you create organization's account, you declare you have a legal title to represent the organization in accepting terms of service of the product your organization is using. The user who creates organization's account automatically becomes it's administrator. 

Administrator is at the same time also a user. User account cannot be transitioned, but another user can be appointed administrator instead of the current one. Some of our products may include ability to have more than one administrative account.

It is your organization's responsibility to appoint desired account administrators and manage their access and it's transition. 

## No warranty

We do not give warranty or take responsibility for any damage made to your business by account administrators or other users given access to your organization's resources through our products. 

## Credit card details

If credit card is attached to the organization for automated billing, the change of the adminstrative role does not remove the attached card.

## What happens when none of the current account administrators are available?

It happens — people switch jobs, get laid off, go on extended leave — the account owner(s) may be unavailable for any number of reasons. 

The quickest route to add a new administrator is often to contact a administrator account owner, and ask them to log in and add another administrator right away.

To appoint the new administrator when the old one is unavailable, please keep in mind you will need to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt the title organization's account ownersip. Please contact [support](mailto:{{ support }}). 

For certain products a court order may required to add another owner to the account. We will of course readily comply with any court orders to turn data over to the appropriate party.

## What if I have another question about ownership?

{{ company_name }} may update this policy once in a blue moon — we’ll notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by placing a prominent notice on our site. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time by contacting [support](mailto:{{ support_email }}).
