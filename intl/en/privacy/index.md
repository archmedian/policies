# Privacy policy

*Last updated: May 7, 2020*

## 1. General Overview

To {{ company_name }} the th1.e privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a critical value. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We work to protect your information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, manipulation, or damage.    

This policy applies to all products made available by {{ owner_legal_name }}.

## 2. Basic Principle

In the nutshell we apply EU GDPR to processing your personal information. It is one of the the world's strictest privacy regulations. If you access our products from Switzerland, United States:
* The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) for the users in USA
* Swiss Federal Data Protection Act for users in Switzerland

## 3. Legal basis

There are three main legal bases for us to collect your personal information:

* your consent
* fulfilment of agreement between you and us (terms of service)
* legal requirements (e.g. we are requuired to keep financial transaction records)
* legally justified interest (for example hacking attacks prevention and protection of our users data or our products and services)

## 4. What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:

### 4.1. Identity & access

When you sign up for a {{ company_name }} product, we typically ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, phone number and maybe a company name. That’s just so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you invoices, updates, or other essential information. We sometimes also give you the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products, but we do not normally look at or access that picture. We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.

### 4.2. Billing information

When you pay for a {{ company_name }} product, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That's so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your credit card is passed directly to our payment processor and doesn't ever go through our servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number and as-of billing address, for account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address to calculate any sales tax due in the United States, to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, and to print on your invoices.

### 4.3. Payment processing

We use leading payment processor provider, PayPal. You can find their privacy policies here: [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full). We send your name and e-mail address to Paypal during a payment process. We also use Stripe for credit card payments. You can find the privacy policy [here](https://stripe.com/de/privacy).

### 4.4. Geolocation data

We log all access to all accounts by full IP address so that we can always verify no unauthorized access has happened. We keep this login data for as long as your product account is active.

We also log full IP addresses used to sign up a product account. We keep this record forever because they are used to mitigate spammy signups.

Web analytics data — described further in the Website Interactions section — are also tied temporarily to IP addresses to assist with troubleshooting cases.

### 4.5. Website interactions

When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs. We sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some design decisions. 

We use third parties (subprocessors) to track and analyze user journey through our websites and products. You can learn more here: [subprocessors](../subprocessors/index.md)

## 5. Who do we share your data with

### 5.1. Other users

For some of our products we share your first name, initial of last name, photography and - when you authorize us - phone number with the other users of the same platform. We do it only when you subscribe for it and this is what the platform is for. 

### 5.2. Third-party service provider

We use cloud server providers to host your data. They have high and certified security mechanisms and we have proper agreements with them on guaranteeing security of your data.

### 5.3. IT Contractors

We cooperate with IT service providers who may have temporary and limmited access to your data in very rare cases. If this is needed, we require highest security standards and sign proper contracts with those companies.

### 5.4. Authorities

When required by court order in {{ company_legal_jurisdiction }}

## 6. Remarketing

We use remarketing mechanisms. This means, in a nutshell, that after visiting our product website we may show you our ads on some other websites, for example on Facebook Google or LinkedIn. This allows us to reach to the potential clients who are interested, rather than showing ads to everybody.

You can opt-out from this using these third-party website settings, in particular you can change it on following sites:

- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/562973647153813?helpref=about_content)
- [Google](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated)

We use third parties (subprocessors) to facilitate remarketting process. You can learn more here: [subprocessors](../product/{product_1_code}/subprocessors/index.md)

## 7. Advertising

Many of our paid products are ad-free or allow for premioum ad-free plan. 

However, advertising is one of the sources of our income. That's why we need to display advertisments on some of our products, websites or emails. To make them least annoying we try to target them the best we can. 

 These advertisements can be targeted based on the information that is available to us such as language, anonymised geolocation, etc. This always happens in an automated manner; no human is looking at this data. 
 
 Sometimes we display adverts from Google’s AdSense, AdExchange. When this happens Google targets ads based on the content of our website and the other information Google has aobut you. We don't control the process. You can review Google’s Ads Privacy Policy [here](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/). You can configure ads preferences in Google’s Ads Preferences Manager. 
 
 We may also use other third-party advertising companies to show you ads when you visit our websites or products. TO learn more or opt out, please see [opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

## 8. Cookies and Do Not Track

We use two kinds of cookies - technical (required) and optional. You can read more details in our [Cookies Policy](../product/{product_code}/cookies/cookies_policy.md)

At this time, our sites and applications do not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by browser plugins.

## 9. Automated decision-making and profiling

In some of our products we use automated decision making and profiling based on gender, geographic location, relationship with other users or belonging to organizations ( for example when company buys
 our product for their employies )

## 10. Social Login

We use third party platforms such us google, facebook, linkedin etc. to allow for one-click login ("social login"). Some of these tools can track the fact that you logged in using them. Please check their privacy policies to learn more:

* [Google privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* [Microsoft privacy policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com)
* [Facebook privacy policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php)
* [LinkedIn privacy policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy)

### 10.1 Voluntary correspondence

When you write to {{ company_name }} with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.

We also store any information you volunteer like surveys. Sometimes when we do customer interviews, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We only do so if you give your express consent.

### 10.2. Information we do not collect

We may collect limited characteristics of protected classifications like age, gender, gender identity, or gender expression. We don't require this information, but we respect your right of self-expression or to be addressed in the way you like. 

In some of our products meant for contacting people we give option to restrict the availability for contact by age or gender.

We do not collect biometric data. In some of our products you are given the option to add a picture to your user profile, which could be a real picture of you or a picture of something else that represents you best. We do not extract any information from profile pictures: they are for your use alone.

## 11. When we access or share your information

Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we’ll ever access or share your info are:

* **To provide products or services you've requested**. We do use some third-party services to run our applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your personal information via these third parties. You can view the list of third-party services we use here: [Subprocessors](../product/{product_code}/subprocessors/inde.xmd). Having subprocessors means we are using technology to access your data. No {{ company_name }} human looks at your data for these purposes.
* **To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.** If at any point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.
* **To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding [restricted uses](../abuse/index.md).** Accessing a customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.
* **When required under applicable law.** If the appropriate law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring we share data, we have to comply. Otherwise, we flat-out reject requests from law enforcement when they seek data. And unless we’re legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made. ***We have never received a National Security Letter or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) order.***

If {{ owner_legal_name }} in it's entirety or it's product is acquired by or merged with another company — we don’t plan on that, but if it happens — we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## 12. Location of Site and Data

Our databases are located on cloud servers in {{ data_location_countries }}. Our products and other web properties are operated in the {{ country_of_operation }}. If you are located outside of European Union, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to European Union. By using our site or products, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.

## 13. Transfer of Personal Data abroad

We are entitled to transfer your Personal Data abroad, including to third party companies (designated service providers) to the minimal extent that is necessery for Data Processing described in this Privacy Policy. 

The service providers will be required to protect Your Data to the same extent as us. If the level of data protection in a their country is lower than in the EU, we will require EU-level of your data protection by the contract. We will further ensure it with following means:

* concluding EU Model Clauses with the appointed service providers, [read more](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_de)
* making sure that the appointed service providers are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield (where the data recipient is based in the USA or stores the data there) [read more](https://www.privacyshield.gov/)
* by making sure service providers have  Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) in place, that are recognised by a European data protection authority, [read more](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/binding-corporate-rules_en)

## 14. Your Rights With Respect to Your Information

At {{ company_name }}, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in the US. {{ company_name }} recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:

* **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
* **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
* **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
* **Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”.** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using {{ company_name }} services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
* **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).
* **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data).
* **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
* **Right to Portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
* **Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
* **Right to Non-Discrimination.** This right stems from the CCPA. We do and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information. If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at [{{ privacy_email }}](mailto:{{ privacy_email }}) or at {{ owner_legal_name }}, {{ company_address_l1 }}, {{ company_address_l3 }}. To identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find out more about GDPR, EU individuals should go to [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).

## 15. How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted. Most data are not encrypted while they live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.

For more information about how we keep your information secure, please review our [security overview](../security/index.md).

## 16. When you delete your account

We delete your data after an account is cancelled. Your data are purged within 60 days. This applies both for cases when an account owner directly cancels and for auto-cancelled accounts. Please refer to our [Cancellation policy](../cancellation/index.md) for more details.

## 17. Changes

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. You can view a history of the changes to our policies. [on Github]({{ policies_repo_url }}).
