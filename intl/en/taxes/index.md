# Taxes!

Taxes are an important part of functional society. Where software-as-a-service (SaaS) is taxable, we collect and remit sales and consumption taxes to governments. If your billing address is in one of the following jurisdictions, you’ll see a line item on your invoice for sales tax or VAT. The tax rate and rules are determined by each jurisdiction and sometimes vary by whether you are using our products for business/commercial or personal purposes. As regulations change, we will update this list.

## Jurisdictions we collect and remit taxes for

### Within the US
Currently we don't collect sales tax in The United States. This is due to fact that our headquarters is in {{ country_of_operation }}. We operate globally and only small portion of our sales is to The United States.

### Within the EU
We collect VAT on any direct-to-consumer sales to EU-based customers.
